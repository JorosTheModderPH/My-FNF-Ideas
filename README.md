## Introduction

My FNF ideas include mods, sketches, mechanics, and more.

Also, a minor spoiler for my mods if you're watching this repository. (if any)

# What to do here?

Just check out any of my ideas to give you some ideas.
It's a bit pointless, but you can try.

# Why create this repository?

So I can share my ideas. Maybe it can help you get some ideas by checking out any of my ideas here (mostly for mechanics), but I also save some of my own mod ideas to reserve them later, just in case I lose them.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
